     1) When game is over, it should store the player names, scores, date, and game state to the cloud.
     Need an observer to trigger this?
     
     2) Provide methods to retrieve the necessary history items for the historyTableView from the cloud OR
     simply download the entire history in it's model and the table can access this directly??
