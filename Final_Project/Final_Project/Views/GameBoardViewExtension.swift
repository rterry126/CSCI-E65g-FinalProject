// So I was going to have the detail page of the history play back the game. For this I needed parts of the custom view. I pulled out
// what I though I might need and put in a protocol extension so I wouldn't have to duplicate code.
// That project never came to fruition, however I decided to keep this 'common' code in the extension.
